460 million deaf individuals live on our Planet. Despite this staggering number, the majority of the population cannot communicate with them, creating a language barrier. SIGNify can break this barrier. SIGNify, a soon-to-be App, is a computer program that bridges the gap between the deaf and mute with the rest of the world. With just a camera, individuals will be able to understand ASL in real time, converting the hand gestures of the deaf/mute to the English language. 
Whether for education or accessibility, SIGNify helps individuals communicate with the rest of the world, a necessary move towards breaking barriers.

Currently, SIGNify is developing Python Program that is able to take camera input, analyze the user's hand, and output the corresponding letter in English. It can do so for all 26 letters and is done so with computer vision and machine learning models from the web. It is currently able to go one way; ASL hand gestures to English letters. However, in the future I aim to achieve more services such as going from English letters to ASL hand gestures, speech to ASL hand gestures, and more all within the control of one app. All of these features will be incorporated into one seamless app, which can allow switching between these features.
